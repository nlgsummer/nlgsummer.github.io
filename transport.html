        <h1>Travelling to Aberdeen</h1>

        <div class="text_content first_text_content">
            <p>The University is located within a city at the heart of a diverse and thriving regional economy. Aberdeenâ€™s pivotal role in the international oil and gas industry means that it enjoys excellent communications and travel links.</p>
<h2>By Air</h2>
<p>Aberdeen's international airport is served by a number of major carriers, providing an extensive network of routes throughout the UK, direct to Europe and worldwide through major hubs.</p>
<p>British and Irish destinations include four London airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, London City and Luton - just over an hour's flight time), Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Dublin, Durham Tees Valley, Exeter, Humberside, Leeds Bradford, Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, East Midlands, Southampton, as well as the Scottish Highlands and Islands.</p>
<p>European mainland destinations include Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Oslo and Paris.</p>
<p>There is a frequent bus link or taxis available to take you to the city centre.</p>

</ul>
<h2>By Car</h2>
<p>Entering the city from the south or west, follow signs for the A90 (Fraserburgh and Peterhead). This leads round the ring road (Anderson Drive). Exiting from a roundabout (signed Old Aberdeen) onto Cairncry Road, continue to follow the A90 signs through two further roundabouts onto St. Machar Drive. After a third roundabout, the road bisects Old Aberdeen and local signs will direct you to University sites. From the north, Old Aberdeen is signposted on the A96 (from Dyce and Inverness) and on the A90 (from Peterhead).</p>
