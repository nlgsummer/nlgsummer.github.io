  <h1 id="h1">Natural Language Summer School</h1>
  <p>
  The objective of this summer school is to introduce participants to the
  concepts and research questions in natural language generation (NLG),
  summarisation and dialogue systems. Although these three areas produce
  natural language, their distinct communities seldom interact because each
  community relies on different methods and because the inputs to each kind of
  system are different. There is, however, considerable overlap in the kinds of
  problems that need to be considered, from selecting the right content to
  evaluating the systems. We believe that focusing on the similarities of the
  different areas can stimulate "cross-pollination" of research. For example,
  most summarisation techniques could benefit from deeper semantic processing as
  performed in dialogue systems. Similarly, many NLG systems could benefit from
  techniques used by dialogue systems to substantially improve the generated
  output.

<h2>Course Summary</h2>
<ol>
    <li><span class="title">Introduction to NLG: </span><br>
        The basic concepts of NLG will be introduced, including document planning, microplanning,           and realisation.  Also examples of real NLG systems will be presented, including both what           they do and how they work.</li>
    <li>
    <span class="title"> NLG in detail </span><ul>
         <li><span class="title">Content Determination:</span></li>
        This talk will summarise existing approaches to content determination for NLG, as well as touching on the closely related topics of text ordering and structuring.  It will discuss why content determination is hard and what sorts of (hand-crafted or learned) models can be used to inform it. It is often useful to regard content determination as a search problem, and we will take this approach in order to compare the different methods that have been used.

    </li>
    <li><span class="title">Introduction to Summarisation:</span>

    </li>
    <li><span class="title">Introduction to Dialogue Systems: </span><br>
The module will start with a question: What is dialogue? We will survey studies on human-human dialogue in search for a tentative answer. We then compare and contrast human-human dialogue with human-machine dialogue. This will lead us to an examination of various dialogue systems - past and present. We will consider dialogue system architectures and approaches to dialogue management. The module concludes with a look at recent developments, from incremental processing in dialogue to models of non-cooperative dialogue.
    </li>
    <li> <span class="title">Introduction to Machine Learning for NLG </span><br>
    </li>
    <li> <span class="title">Evaluation: </span><br>
         Different ways to evaluate NLG systems will be discussed, including task-based, human-              based, and metric-based; what can we learn from these different types of evaluation?  We            will also summarise practice in each of these types of evaluations, and present the design          and outcomes of several real NLG evaluations.

        <li><span class="title">Creative Language Generation </span> by <span class="lec">Graeme Ritchie</span> <br>
        Over the past two decades, the field of computational creativity has come into being, and grown considerably. Its aim is "to model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer". To this end, most of the work focusses on building software which engages in activities commonly thought, within society, to be creative, such as visual art, concept generation, musical composition, etc. Many of these domains involve natural language (e.g. poetry, stories, jokes), and hence such work can be seen as a subarea, creative language generation. This talk will give a general introduction to the field of computational creativity, briefly review some of the language-based work, and discuss some of the methodological issues raised by such research.
