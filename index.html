  <p>
  The objective of this summer school is to introduce participants to the
  concepts and research questions in natural language generation (NLG),
  summarisation and dialogue systems. Although these three areas produce
  natural language, their distinct communities seldom interact because each
  community relies on different methods and because the inputs to each kind of
  system are different. There is, however, considerable overlap in the kinds of
  problems that need to be considered, from selecting the right content to
  evaluating the systems. We believe that focusing on the similarities of the
  different areas can stimulate "cross-pollination" of research. For example,
  most summarisation techniques could benefit from deeper semantic processing as
  performed in dialogue systems. Similarly, many NLG systems could benefit from
  techniques used by dialogue systems to substantially improve the generated
  output.
