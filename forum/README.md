## Creating Category Groups

Create a new page in the category-groups folder, it should have the following settings:

* *category-group* - always set to true
* *id* - the id of the category group
* *title* - the display title for the category group
* *layout* - default is category-group, but doesn't really matter
* *summary* - displayed as descriptive text on the category group listing

Once you are done, go ahead and updating the `group-id` of some categories.

## Creating Categories

First, create the category in Disqus.  Login and go to Admin >> Settings >> Advanced.  Click *Add New Category* and then give your category a name.  Click *Save Changes* and note the category id.

Next, create a new page in the categories directory.  It must have the following settings:

* *group-id* - the id of the group in which the category should display
* *category* - always set to true
* *id* - the id of the discus category
* *title* - the display title for the category
* *layout* - generally should be category, unless you customize the layouts
* *summary* - displayed as descriptive text on the category listing

The contents of the category page will be shown in a jumbotron on the category page by default.

## Managing Discussions

Users can create discussions at any point.  To manage your discussions, login to Disqus and select Admin >> Discussions.  To remove a discussion from the form, change it's category to General.
